# Coordination Game Simulations
Scripts for running simulations in evolutionary game theory, built for coordination games, but any payoff matrix can be specified. Playaers can be placed on a sinlge or a multi-layer network. Different strategy updates are possible - the best response, the unconditional imitation, or the replicaor dynamics.
